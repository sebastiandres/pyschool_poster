**Title**: PySchool - Introducing highschool students to the World of Python

**TLDR;** We used challenges to motivate highschoolers to learn Python, using a no-installation-required website powered with quarto + pyodide. They loved it!

**Poster created by**: Sebastián Flores

**Collaborators**:
- Content: Francisco Alfaro, Tony Rodríguez
- Coordination: Darwin Morales, Patricia Tapia, Marcelo Figueroa.
- Volunteers: Bastián Blandskron, Cristina Verdugo, Cristian López, Liliana Garmendia, Valeska Canales, Yialenne Alviña, and Marifer Villalobos.

## The past

- Motivation: events are organized by Python Chile (PyDay and PyCon) were aimed towards grownups. We **dreamed of** an event targetting highschool students.
- Philosophy: We know we can't teach Python in a day, but we can show how simple and fun coding in Python can be, and motivate them to learn Python.
- How: quarto+pyodide allowed us to code a simple website in Spanish (pyschool.cl) that does not requires users to install Python! It's simpler to use than jupyter notebooks.
- Activities: Intro to Python (1h) and Intro to Data Analysis (1h).
- Events: # X students, on 3 events done in Valparaíso, Chile.
- Feedback:  We had 9.3/10 stars on anonymous surveys.

## The present
- Learn from the feedback:
  - Lab setup difficults interaction! 
  - Traditional classes are boring, challenges and discussion works wonders
- We redid the site as a "escape room" where Python puzzles need to be solved.
- We will be testing this new approach on the second half of 2025.
  
## The future?
TO DO LIST:
- Make it scalable  
For this project to grow, we need a "train the trainers" approach: make it easily replicable by anyone interested, without needing us to provide support. 
- Translate to other languages  
English? French? Italian?  
Licence is MIT - feel free what it's valuable to you and translate it, replicate, mix, whatever.
Volunteer if you want to help!

## Help us!

- **Share**: Let others know about PySchool!
- **Give us Feedback**: Let us know what might improve PySchool! 
- **Try it!**: Quarto + Pyodide can help you create interactive websites. Attendees won't need to install Python on workshops, talks or documentation!
- **Network and Learn**: We’re excited to meet other Python enthusiasts and educators to talk about teaching Python, learning methods, and new technologies.
